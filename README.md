IMDB ratings
===============

**[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imdb-ratings/fbbcaooelpdopodjcneapidogdpelfeg)** for displaying IMDB ratings in listings. Check [extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imdb-ratings/fbbcaooelpdopodjcneapidogdpelfeg) for screenshots.

Features:

* Displays rating for each movie in a filmography section of a person (actor/director/etc.)
* Grays out _inferior_ content from listing, based on rating and relevance*
* Generates a person rating based on its titles**

\* TV items need a higher rating to not be grayed out (since they usually have higher ratings than regular movies to begin with), and stuff like video games are dismissed from the start

\** Only the first filmography section (IMDB sets most relevant as first) is used for calculating the person score

Uses [The OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) for fetching the ratings data.
